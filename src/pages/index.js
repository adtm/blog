        <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Tomas </p>
        <p>
          I'm a software engineer @ Wix, who's searching the world trying to
          understand myself and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the moment I'm being proactive in the startup field, participating
          at incubators, hackatons and creating projects for myself. Similary
          the idea of this blog came along - wanting to create something for
          myself to remember, and maybe others to scroll by.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main virtue is people, not technology, as I trully believe that
          people are everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore don't be afraid to say hi or ask questions. I'm also freely
          reachable at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomas-eglinskas">@LinkedIn</a> and  <a href="mailto:tomas.eglinskas@gmail.com">@Mail</a>
