      Hey{" "}

    <p>
      I'm Tomas, a software engineer @Wix, who's searching the world trying to
      understand myself and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment I'm being proactive in the startup field, participating at
      incubators, hackatons and creating projects for myself. Similary the idea
      of this blog came along - wanting to create something for myself to
      remember, and maybe others to scroll by.
    </p>
    <p>
      My main virtue is people, not technology, as I trully believe that people
      are everything.
    </p>
    <p>Therefore don't be afraid to say hi or ask questions.</p>
