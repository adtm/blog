Birthdays are special, we celebrate one more year we managed to survive and become a little more mature (or less). The year of being 23 (Kobe Bryan's number), was quite special for me - a lot of things happened, a lot has changed and is yet to change. 

Even though I can say that I'm "fully" in tech for 3 years, I can say that I have been on my tech journey with many different companies - every being unique in its own way. Like it's said that the 5 closest people have the biggest impact on you,

But before turning 24 I decided to reflect a little more what is tech for me and what it's about. These are my views - I think everyone has something to add to this.

### 1. People

I like people. 
And they're everything.

But I didn't knew it all the time. When starting my first jobs I always tought that learning the most trendy technologies will make me a better developer, this way I'll stand out and be looked up. 


### 2. Purpose

Not everyone wants to change the world, and surely not everyone should. But being a developer you have the power to create something of value, to solve problems. Therefore it's always rewarding when your work has some impact - it can be internally or outside your company. 

When I worked for one company we had to create an internal system for the music industry. The project was great, it had all the technologies one could want, the freedom to offer new solutions, but it lacked feedback. We created the system from scratch for more than a year, but no one showed any interest in what we were doing, nobody said anything, nobody cared. It was as if we're creating this for ourselves.

It's the usual case in my country that people are outsourced for other companies ($$$) and that's business. But I feel enjoyment when I can see the fruits of my work and be in the loop of the product.

If one is similar, the best options would be to work for a company with its own products or work towards your own startup idea.


### 3. Hapiness

For a long period of time I believed that money is the answer to hapiness, my route to freedom. And even though one needs money to live a sustainable life, it's not my answer to the puzzle.

The answer is the thing which gives you the most hapiness and I'm not talking about eating. Nowadays you will always find someone who will outwork you. Therefore you have to find something which you can do without feeling it's a job. Eventually, you'll think of a way to monetize it.

For someone it maybe there daily job, and that's perfectly fine. Some people are more happy to work for someone else than create a company and vice versa.

If there is a lack of happiness, you need to take action and find it. Maybe you're job is a pain, maybe you want to travel to Asia, maybe you just feel a lack of purpose in your daily life.

Take action and don't be afraid to change things.
