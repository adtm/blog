Birthdays are special, we celebrate one more year we managed to survive and become a little more mature (or less). The year of being 23 (Kobe Bryan's number), was quite special for me - a lot of things happened, a lot has changed and is yet to change. 

Even though I can say that I'm "fully" in tech for 3 years, I can say that I have been on my tech journey with many different companies - every being unique in its own way. Like it's said that the 5 closest people have the biggest impact on you,

But before turning 24 I decided to reflect a little more what is tech for me and what it's about. These are my views - I think everyone has something to add to this.

### 1. People

I like people. And they're everything.

But probably one who knew me a couple years would be surprised with this statement. I was that tipical developer who would code inside and outside of work, prioritise learning the new trendy technologies and read a bunch of articles about things I didn't have a clue.

And as I still do most of these things, I just do them for very different reasons. I don't care about those weekly new technologies popping up, I have my tools and if I'll need something - I'll learn it. I don't code cause I want to try a new technology - I build products with my friends 


But I didn't knew it all the time. When starting my first jobs I always tought that learning the most trendy technologies will make me a better developer, this way I'll stand out and be looked up. 


### 2. Purpose

In my view, purpose is one of the most important things in life. If you're doing something you don't know why, you'll eventually stop it. If you're seeking freedom, starting a personal company or just wanting to have impact in a specific niche, you have to understand why. If the stimulus is money, not working or fame - you'll mostly fail without even starting. If you know you're why and you're fully into it - you'll create your own path to achieve it and will start to love the journey, not the end result.

And not everyone should want to change the world. If you're a lawyer and you're passion is cooking, nobody is stopping you from taking on the journey. Life is not about money, it's about hapiness. And if you'll try to chase the other, money will eventually come up by itself. Always, the begginings are always the hardest.

For me, being a developer is one of the paths towards hapiness. Creating value for others, making an impact is rewarding by itself, it keeps me going. And as most of us work 9 - 5, it's rewarding when your work has some impact - internally or outside the company. For example, when I worked for one company we had to create an internal system for the music industry. The project was great, it had all the technologies one could want, the freedom to offer new solutions, but it lacked feedback. We created the system from scratch for more than a year, but no one showed any interest in what we were doing, nobody said anything, nobody cared. It was as if we're creating this for ourselves. I couldn't see the purpose of my work, except being a resource for the company.

Of course, one could argue that working with awesome technologies is rewarding by itself. But truth be told, I don't care about technologies too much, I care about people.


### 3. Hapiness

As you probably understood, I emphasize hapiness. The simple reasoning is that why I should be sad in the first place? I'm responsible for it and no one else, if there is something I don't like - I'll change it. Life is too short to be in regret and sorrow.

But truth be told, for a long period of time I thought that money is the answer to everything. When people are asked what they want to have I always heard materialistic things - money, cars or houses. I even heard people saying that if you answer with hapiness, you don't know what you want in life or you're lying.

If you're happy where you are, you won. It's not about the cars, the luxury life. You don't have to be a co-founder of a company, cause being in a higher role won't suddently make your problems go away. You have to aim for hapiness and take action now, don't hope that there is a magic pill for everything.
