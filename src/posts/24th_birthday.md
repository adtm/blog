Birthdays are special events where we celebrate becoming a bit more adults and mature people (not so really). Therefore I dediced to look back at how I view tech in general, what are mine current virtues and viewpoints.

1. People - during all my experience that people are more important, not the technologies you're using or what advanced solutions you're trying to come up. Of course having a strong technical background will never harm you, but being with people you feel comfortable with, pushing you forward will be one of the main reasons you'll stay in a company.
2. Purpose - 
3. Simple things
4. Enjoyment & Fun
