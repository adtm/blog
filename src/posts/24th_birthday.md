I like birthdays cause it's that moment in year when one can reflect what happened. I promised last year to put myself and don't hesitate anymore. As a result the previous year was quite a roller coaster for me and it shaped me a lot. 

As I like to write weekly reflections, this time I decided to make a blog and write my first post about my priorities and views. Most of these things may sound simple, but that's how everything should be in life.

### 1. People

I like people. And they're everything.

But one who knew me a couple years would be surprised with this statement. I was that typical developer who would code inside and outside of work, focus on learning the new trendy technologies and read a bunch of articles about things I didn't have a clue.

And as I still do most of these things, I do them for very different reasons. I don't care about those weekly new technologies popping up, I have my tools and if I'll need something - I'll learn it. I don't code cause I want to try a new technology - I build products with my friends for other people, because I feel the thrill of talking to users, understanding their behaviour and seeing them smile.

In most of the cases your customers don't care what technology you're using - they want the result for which they agree to pay money. It's about them, not about you.

### 2. Purpose

In my view, purpose is one of the most important things in life. If you're doing something you don't know why, you'll stop it. It can be the desire of freedom, starting a personal company or wanting to have impact in a specific niche. Whatever it may be, you have to understand why you want something. 

And it's normal that it may change, but the stimulus of wanting money or fame are too weak for the long run. When you understand the why and be ready to immense yourself - you'll create your own path and will start to love the journey, not the end result.

And not everyone should want to change the world. If you're a lawyer and you're passion is cooking, nobody is stopping you from taking on the journey. Life is not about money, it's about happiness. And if you'll try to chase the other, money will come up by itself. Always, the beginnings are the hardest.

For me, being a developer is one of the paths towards happiness. Creating value for others, making an impact is rewarding by itself, it keeps me going. And as most of us work 9 - 5, it's rewarding when your work has some impact - internally or outside the company. For example, when I worked for one company we had to create an internal system for the music industry. The project was great, it had all the technologies one could want, the freedom to offer new solutions, but it lacked feedback. We created the system from scratch for more than a year, but no one showed any interest in what we were doing, nobody said anything, nobody cared. It was as if we're creating this for ourselves. I couldn't see the purpose of my work, except being a resource for the company.

Of course, one could argue that working with awesome technologies is rewarding by itself. But truth be told, I don't care about technologies too much, I care about people and being happy.

### 3. Happiness

As you understood, I emphasize happiness. The simple reasoning is that why I should be sad in the first place? I'm responsible for it and no one else, if there is something I don't like - I'll change it. Life is too short to be in regret and sorrow.

But truth be told, for a long period of time I thought that money is the answer to everything. When people are asked what they want to have I always heard materialistic things - money, cars or houses. I even heard people saying that if you answer with hapiness, you don't know what you want in life or you're lying.

If you're happy where you are, you won. It's not about the cars, the luxury life. You don't have to be a co-founder of a company, cause being in a higher role won't make your problems go away. You have to aim for happiness and take action now, don't hope that there is a magic pill for everything.
