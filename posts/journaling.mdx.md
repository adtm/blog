I have started writing my thoughts for around 3/4 years and I believe this was one of my best decisions in life. It's like speaking to yourself, talking what's on your mind, clearing those thoughts and making plans, or sometimes just ranting about the world. Sometimes you don't have people you want to speak about, sometimes you don't want to tell them everything or just want to keep some things personal. Writting should be just a brain dump of what's inside, it's like a mini walk through nature when in reality you're binging in bed. It's like that imaginary child friend who knows your secrets and just listens without judging. 

I truly believe journaling can change your life and would say to try it to everyone. We all like speaking about ourselves, so why don't write about it also?
