For the past 4 years, I worked for companies worth tens of billions of dollars with thousands of engineers under their R&D apartments. These companies were my dream at the beginning of my career. Who doesn't want to work for a well-known established name with fancy perks? Well, don't know how about you, but I at least did, and my LinkedIn did.

In these big companies you'll find complex, overengineered systems where you'll be reading documents from smart people and hoping to become one yourself, at least a bit. If you're lucky - you'll get a system to implement yourself. Or like most of us - you'll become a maintainer of some system which was engineered by that sole 10x engineer and of course, he left after you joined leaving multiple bugs you'll find out with the new incidents. In the beginning, it's fun - cause everything is a steep learning curve but over time you are thrown with these new nouns like "politics", "directors", and "reorganisation" - it starts to become a tad sadder. But you say to yourself - "I get that IPO stock where I can cash out now and not some kind of paper money which you never know if it will be worth anything".

And in the end you start asking yourself - maybe it's time for that paper money adventure?
