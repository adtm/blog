When faced with monotony in daily life, one can try to tackle it in various ways. One can start binge-watching Netflix to get that dopamine increase, the second one can start going out with friends more often in the hope that the empty void of sitting at home will be filled, the third one can do various activities after work hours just in order not to think about the boring life which is bestilled at home. Or as most of us do - change our jobs.  

These actions can add variety, maybe one activity will escalate to some other side-effect which will open new doors, new people and will change you dramatically. But, in my opinion, this is not very often the result - after some time you will get bored again and search for a different source of excitement. These thoughts of change come to differentiate the surrounding environment, give some excitement or fill in the empty time. Maybe you will find your source of happiness and settle down, accepting life as it is, which probably happens more naturally when you get older.

Without leaving people, filling all personal life timeslots or changing jobs - find a mission that would enhance your **spiritually**. Not everyone needs independence and unlimited money. Maybe you want to create a product, improve your existing relationships or take those small risks you can remember after numerous years. Think in the *present* moment and have a defined "why?", be the authentic you and enjoy life to its broadest potential.
